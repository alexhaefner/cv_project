Work done by Alex Haefner as part of EECS 442 Umich Fall 2012.

/cv_project contains all the c++ files/images
/cv_project/cprofiles contains some useful performance data.  Must be opened on
a mac

The base directory contains the original opencv python version of the application.

NOTE: the app probably won't work if you try to load it and run it.  You'll
need to change the path of the images in main.cpp to load the initial hand and
background images.  Otherwise the first phase of the program where it builds
the hand and background gaussians will fail.
